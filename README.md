Curriculum
==========

* [Michael's Guide to Becoming a Data Scientist](https://github.com/airalcorn2/Michael-s-Guide-to-Becoming-a-Data-Scientist)
* <a name="Math"></a>**Math**
  * Over the course of my math studies, I learned that the [French have a reputation for teaching math a particular way from a young age](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-reasons-the-french-are-so-good-at-mathematics-What-are-some-best-practices-at-policy-level-in-school-or-university-that-could-be-emulated-in-a-developing-country), and I think I'm a fan.
  * <a name="Calculus"></a>**Calculus**
      * Textbooks
          * [Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus, with an Introduction to Linear Algebra](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP001951.html) (Apostol) Apostol's textbooks are classics for a reason. They are a great introduction to calculus and do an excellent job of developing intuition for limits, derivatives, and integrals.
          * [Calculus, Vol. 2: Multi-Variable Calculus and Linear Algebra with Applications to Differential Equations and Probability](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471000078.html) (Apostol)
      * Courses
          * [MA101: Single-Variable Calculus I](https://learn.saylor.org/course/ma101/) (Saylor Academy) - good introduction to calculus. Provided links to different types of learning material from different sources, which I think encourages learning. Seeing/hearing different perspectives on the same material seems to help crystallize concepts often. Really delves into the "why" of differentiation and integration.
          * [MA102: Single-Variable Calculus II](https://legacy.saylor.org/ma102/Intro/) (Saylor Academy) - first two units were entirely redundant with the end of MA101. Unit 3 was fairly painful, with a lot of memorization of integration "tricks". Course felt like somewhat of a hodgepodge of different mathematical concepts without it being entirely clear why they were covered together (e.g., series, differential equations)
          * [18.02: Multivariable Calculus](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/) (MIT) - enjoyed the first two parts, but I got lazy around double line integrals. The physical applications of concepts like curl and flux are interesting, but I was ready to move on to linear algebra. As an aside, MIT uses a two course sequence to teach calculus and I agree that's the way it should be done.
          * [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) (Khan Academy) - Khan Academy produces extremely high quality content for a variety of subjects, and its offerings for multivariable calculus are no different.
  * <a name="Linear-Algebra"></a>**Linear Algebra**
      * Textbooks
          * [Linear Algebra and Its Applications](http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=16+4294922413+4294952008) (Strang) - linear algebra is probably my favorite math course. There is a lot of geometric intuition developed that is really satisfying, and the fact that linear algebra has tons of applications today doesn't hurt. Strang is a great teacher and writer, and his texts are classics for a reason.
          * [Linear Algebra Done Right](http://linear.axler.net/) (Axler)
      * Courses
          * [Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications](http://codingthematrix.com/) (Coursera) - an excellent introduction to linear algebra that develops a deep understanding of the subject beyond just matrices and vectors.
  * <a name="Differential-Equations"></a>**Differential Equations**
      * Textbooks
          * [Ordinary Differential Equations](http://store.doverpublications.com/0486649407.html) (Tenenbaum and Pollard) - differential equations is probably the only math subject that I didn't enjoy. It took me probably two months of trying different materials before I finally just committed to this book. Nothing was engaging me. I think part of my problem with differential equations is that there are a lot of "tricks" involved in coming up with analytical solutions, but neither the process or end result is ever very satisfying. I also didn't ever feel like I was gaining new insight or intuition, which is not how I felt about the other math subjects. If anyone has a reference that they feel really made differential equations “click” for them, I would love to hear about it. I also think the subject would be more enjoyable if it were taught in combination with a science… something like a “Differential Equations in Physics” course. Especially since most differential equations theory was motivated by the study of a physical system in the first place (as many of the biographical sketches of scientists and mathematicians in the book alluded to).
          * [Matrix Differential Equations with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047198633X.html) (Magnus and Neudecker) - if someone was trying to learn differential equations quickly and knew some linear algebra, I would tell them to skip ordinary differential equations and to go straight to this book. Almost all interesting problems today involve many variables interacting in complex ways, so partial differential equations are the more relevant differential equations, and, in my opinion, they can be taught entirely independently of ODEs.
      * Courses
          * [Introduction to Differential Equations](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-differential-equations-bux-math226-1x-0) (edX) - this is the first course in a three course sequence on differential equations, but I didn't finish the later ones. I don't know what it is about differential equations or they way I've seen them presented, but this course was very hard for me to get through.
  * <a name="Advanced-Math"></a>**Advanced**
      * These subjects are only necessary for those who want to achieve a deeper understanding of the math behind machine learning/probability.
      * <a name="Analysis"></a>**Analysis**
        * Textbooks
            * [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](http://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/principles-mathematical-analysis-rudin/007054235X.html) (Rudin) - analysis delves into the "why" of math and does so by deriving the existence of various mathematical concepts (e.g., the real and complex numbers, differentiation) from very simple initial building blocks (i.e., sets, addition, and multiplication). Like abstract algebra, it is an interesting subject, but it's probably only practically relevant to individuals pursuing math at higher levels. Subjects that use some analysis for derivations/proofs will generally provide the necessary background.
      * <a name="Topology"></a>**Topology**
        * Textbooks
          * [Topology](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Munkres-Topology-2nd-Edition/PGM56881.html) (Munkres) - felt like a continuation of analysis. Fun to think about, not very practical for people not studying [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space).
      * <a name="Abstract-Algebra"></a>**Abstract Algebra**
        * Textbooks
          * [Algebra](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Artin-Algebra-2nd-Edition/PGM218164.html) (Artin) - this was the first math subject I encountered where it was clear that it was mostly for people who wanted to pursue math at a higher level (just to clarify, the subject I'm discussing here is typically referred to as "[abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra)", so it's not the same subject you learned in primary school). That is, there was very little that could be taken from this subject and applied in non-mathematical settings. With that being said, the subject is really interesting, and there are some applications in computer science (e.g., monads and monoids, which are concepts in [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory), also come up in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)).
